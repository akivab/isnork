Map "empty" contains no creatures of either positive or negative values.  Our
group wants to experiment with getting divers to cluster together in small
groups, an a map with no other stimuli will be excellent for testing our
clustering algorithms.  It is also good for testing raw exploration algorithms:
some of last year's divers performed abysmally on this map, essentially giving
up without even exploring the whole board.  Others seemed to do quite well:
moving around in random patterns, and returning to the boat only at the very
end.
